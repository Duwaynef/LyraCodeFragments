intresting code fragments from lyra cpp

## GiveAbilityWithInputTag

With this code you can make a blueprint actor (this as the base class) and it will give you the ability to grant a play a ability
during gameplay with an input tag attached. (something i haven't been able to figure out how to do without cpp)
