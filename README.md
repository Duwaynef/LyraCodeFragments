intresting code fragments from lyra cpp

## GiveAbilityWithInputTag

With this code you can make a blueprint actor ( this as the base class ) and it will give you the ability to grant a ability ( or many )
during gameplay with an input tag attached. This is something i haven't been able to figure out how to do without cpp.

You can configure an array of:
  - Gameplay ability
  - InputTag
  - Ability level
  - If the ability stacks

And display debug messages that will show all abilities the user has
